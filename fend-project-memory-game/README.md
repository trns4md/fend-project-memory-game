## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Project Notes

The following project is an interactive Memory Game project.  The HTML and CSS files were modified to some degree, but the majority of the changes to the project exists in the Javascript file.

The goal was to use only Javascript in making the game interactive. The cards match, the moves are counted, the timer starts when the first move is counted.  At the end there is a modal that appears to congratulate the player.  There is a reset button, play again button, and a button to close the modal at the end.

There is are two bugs that I could not figure out how to fix.  The first is that there could be more than two cards selected if you click quickly.  The second is, when the cards are reshuffled, they no longer become clickable.
